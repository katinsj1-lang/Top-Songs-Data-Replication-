IMPORTANT!!!!!!! WHEN PASTING YOUR SCRIPT, MAKE SURE YOU ARE MANUALLY INPUTTING THE NAME OF YOUR CSV FILE!!!


The raw list of songs can be found here: https://ca.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2025-08-09


From this list of songs, two primary variables were used. Chart Peak and Chart Duration
Chart Duration refers to the number of weeks a song remained on the top 100 chart.
Chart Peak refers to the lowest numerical position the song achieved on the top 100 chart. (Remember, 1 is a better value than 100)
